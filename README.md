This project focuses on detecting malicious URLs using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The model classifies URLs as either benign or malicious based on various features extracted from their structure and content.

## Features
- **Dataset Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses URL data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts lexical, host-based, and content-based features.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning models to classify URLs.
- **Evaluation:** Analyzes the performance of different models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
